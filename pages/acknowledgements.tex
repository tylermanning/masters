  I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Jia Yuan Yu for accepting me into his lab and pushing the limit of my intellectual understanding to places I have never thought possible. 
  
  I would also like to thank all my colleagues at DRW who have helped me learn about the finance industry over the past two years. I am especially grateful to Yves, Neil and Laura, who have been very patient with me and have me taught me a lot about understanding financial markets, writing clean code and building robust statistical models.
  
  Lastly, I would like to thank my fianc√©e, Tanya, who initially pushed me to go back to school while I was still young and had the opportunity.
