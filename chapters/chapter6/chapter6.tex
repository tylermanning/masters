\chapter{Conclusion}
\section{Summary of Thesis}
In chapter 1 we briefly introduce the change point detection problem and different considerations one must make when trying to solve it. 

Chapter 2 dives deeper into the online change point detection and its origins from hypothesis testing. A formal description of online is presented along with common evaluation metrics. Fundamental online change point algorithms such as Shewart control charts, CUSUM and exponentially weighted moving averages are covered as well. 

Chapter 3 covers kernel change point detection and the covers all the kernel machinery necessary for understanding the kernel-based statistic used in online change point detection. A review of the most recent kernel change point detection literature is covered and three recent methods are covered in detail as they are used for experiments in chapter 4. An novel method for an online calculation of the median heuristic is also presented. 

Chapter 4 compares the kernel versions of EWMA, CUSUM and Shewart control charts using various synthetic datasets. 

Finally, in chapter 5 we use apply kernel change point methods to market liquidity for various future contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. A brief overview of the limit order book and how liquidity fluctuates is presented.  

The novel aspects of this thesis include the wide array of experiments run in sections across various online kernel change point methods. The introduction of an online median heurtistic calculation that can fit into any online change point detection method that relies on the median heuristic for kernel bandwidth tuning. Finally, we explore market liquidity of several financial future instruments on the CME by running a non-parametric online algorithm on recent market data.

\section{Discussion and Future Work}

While we tried to cover many different type of experiments in chapter 4, we tried to highlight the difficulty in exhaustively testing detecting change points non-parametrically in an online fashion. The hope of this is to spur more research in this direction so that future methods may all be compared against a holistic dataset that is agreed upon by the research community.

Another focus of this thesis was using the MMD for online change point detection. It would interesting to explore other statistical distances that could compare two distributions non-parametrically. It would be interesting to re-use the same approaches explored in this thesis, but with the MMD swapped for a different distance measure. For example, build EWMA-based statistics using another metric that is capable of differentiating between two distributions. 

Recently, interesting research has been made on re-purposing binary classifiers as two-sample tests. In \cite{hediger2019use}, random forests are compared to different implementations of MMD. The authors run many tests comparing the test power across the different two-sample tests and their random forest. The results are interesting because while the random forest classifier is not better in every situation, it is better on hard two-sample tests such as the blobs dataset. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether these classifier approaches to two-sample testing can be adapted to online change point detection in an efficient manner. This later explored in \cite{lopez2016revisiting}.

On the finance side, we believe there is a lot of potential for researching the mechanics of market liquidity.
