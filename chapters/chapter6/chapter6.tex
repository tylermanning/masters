\section{Discussion and Future Work}

One focus of this thesis was using the MMD measure for two-sample testing and, by extension, for change point detection. It would interesting to explore other statistical distances that could compare two distributions non-parametrically. It would be interesting to re-use the same approaches explored in this thesis, but with the MMD swapped for a different distance measure. 

Recently, interesting research has been made on re-purposing binary classifiers as two-sample tests. In \cite{hediger2019use}, random forests are compared to different implementations of MMD. The authors run many tests comparing the test power across the different two-sample tests and their random forest. The results are interesting because while the random forest classifier is not better in every situation, it is better on hard two-sample tests such as the blobs dataset. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether these classifier approaches to two-sample testing can be adapted to online change point detection in an efficient manner.
